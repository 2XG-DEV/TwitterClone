# TwitterClone

This is a twitter-clone I have made using React.
The tehnologies used are React-DOM for the interface, materialUI for the icons , FlipMove for the animations and firebase for the back-end and deployment , you can check it

Currently the app only shows tweets as if sent from the same user , will add google user authentication in the future
